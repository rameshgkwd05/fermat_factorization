# Factorization of RSA numbers n = pq by Fermat’s method
Course project for EE 720: Number theory and Cryptology

#Problem Statement

• Implement the Fermat’s method for factoring RSA numbers n = pq in SAGE for randomly chosen primes upto 10 digit length

• Input: command to generate two primes p, q randomly and compute n = pq.

• Output: Factors of n, factors of p − 1 and q − 1.
